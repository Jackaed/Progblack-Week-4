                In modern times computers are a huge part of our everyday lives,
                however, their use in fighting disease often flies under the
                radar.
            </p>
            <h2>Early Disease Prevention</h2>
            <p> One of the ways that technology is used to fight disease is through early disease detection. Machine
                learning, where computers learn complex data patterns to make predictions, has the potential to
                revolutionise early cancer diagnosis. This is vital in helping more people beat cancer and an example of
                this is lung cancer. 5 year survival rates following stage 1 diagnosis is around 70-90% however, overall
                rates are currently around 15%. This shows the impact and importance in diagnosing the cancer early, and
                artificial intelligence is critical for this.
            </p>
            <h2>Rapid Case identification</h2>
            <p>
                Another key way that computers have been used in recent years to fight disease is rapid case
                identification. This is when computers go through large amounts of data to try and identify patterns and
                was particularly important during the Covid-19 crisis. For example the Track and Trace service that was
                provided worked using computers and helped to prevent many deaths by tracking who you where in contact
                with, and keeping track in bursts of infections. Another way that rapid case identification is used is
                that in airports in Singapore have thermal cameras that systematically identify individuals with a high
                temperature. More can be found out about this <a
