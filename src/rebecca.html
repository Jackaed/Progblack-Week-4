            <h4> Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems that are
                programmed to think and act like humans.
                <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp">
                    The ideal characteristic
                    of AI is its ability to rationalise and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a
                    specific goal.
                </a>
                AI is developed through machine learning, where the computer program can learn
                from and adapt to new data without human assistance. <br>
            </h4>

            <h3>Applications of AI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Self-Driving Cars</li>
                <li>Virtual Assitants</li>
                <li>Spam Filters</li>
                <li>Facial Recognition</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><br>Self-Driving Cars</h4>
            <p>
                Self-driving cars use artificial intelligence to make quick decisions based on the data they are
                receiving, the AI needs to make a split second decision when faced with a situation that could cause a
                crash. For example, if someone crosses the road in front of the car, the AI needs to see this, and
                determine the best course of action to be safe for everyone involved. <br> Self-driving cars will help
                to significantly lower traffic accidents, as there will be far less opportunity for human error,
                <a
                    href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/thenow/what-are-selfdriving-cars/1/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20benefits%20of,driving%2C%20or%20poor%20decision%20making.">
                    which is the cause of more than 90% of all accidents.
                </a>
            </p>

            <h4><br>Virtual Assistants</h4>
            <p> Virtual assistants are AI based software agents that can perform tasks or services for a user based on
                commands from the user. These can be inputted by text, speech, or graphical interface. Examples include:
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/siri/">Siri</a>,
                <a href="https://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>,
                <a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> ,
                and <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>. <br>
                Virtual assistants can be used to help people
                with disabilities, such as blindness, whereby they can speak to their phone and the virtual assistant
                will reply to them without them having to look at their phone. Another benefit to virtual assistants is
                that they improve accessibility to education, as chatbots like ChatGPT can help to summarize topics or
                concepts from a course and improve the user's understanding. This can be especially beneficial to
                non-English speakers, as it can be used in their language so they don't have to struggle with learning a
                difficult concept in a language that they don't understand.
            </p>

            <h4><br>Spam Filters</h4>
            <p> AI algorithms are used for spam filtering, as the system continuously improves through machine learning,
                where it receives vast data sets daily to learn the new ways that spammers try to trick and get past the
                system. These AI systems can also subvert human incompetence, as spammers often attempt to trick filters
                with misspelt words, special characters, and hidden text, relying on human ignorance to overlook these
                anomalies, however the AI system learns to catch these anomalies and not allow them to get through the
                filter.
            </p>

            <h4><br>Facial Recognition</h4>
            <p> Facial recognition systems are forms of AI that use algorithms to determine if a human face is present
                in a visual image, and identify them. Once a face is detected, it is extracted from the digital image,
                then a 'faceprint' is created to identify the individual through
                <a href="https://online.york.ac.uk/the-real-world-impact-of-facial-detection-and-recognition/">marking
                    a vast array of facial features
                </a> <br>
                Facial recognition can be used to secure devices, such as your phone, so that only you can gain access,
                as the password to unlock it is your face. It can also be used in law enforcement to catch culprits, as
                if they have a picture of their face they can run it through their database and find out who that person
                is.
