            <h3>A General Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The entertainment industry has been greatly changed since technology has developed. From CGI in films to
                electronic music to the entire video games industry, computing and technology in general has aided in
                the entertainment industry.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Computing in Films</h3>
            <p>
                A very obvious example of computing in the films industry is animation, a medium for films (though it is
                often considered a genre). For a very long time, animated films were hand-drawn, frame by frame. This
                was a very tedious process and would mean artists would spend weeks or months trying to animate a single
                scene. The creation of 3D animation allowed for animators to make scenes quicker, as every individual
                frame didn't need to be drawn anymore. This form of animation rose to prominence through the 1995 movie
                <i>Toy Story</i> and throughout the 2000s, became the primary animation style, with traditional 2D
                styles becoming a rarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the modern animation industry, 3D animation is the most prominent art style, although there are
                variations in design and technique, such as with stop-motion. Hand-drawn animation is still used, most
                prominently in Japanese <i>anime</i>, but the vast majority of the industry makes use of technology.
            </p>
            <p>Another technique used in the film industry is CGI. Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) is typically used in
                movies to create and modify characters and features, from character's arms to creating whole characters.
                It can also be used for special effects, such as character deaths in horror movies.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Computing in Music</h3>
            <p>Computers are often used in the production of modern music. Electronic music often involves sound board
                and electronic noises and as technology has improved, many recordings of songs involve virtual
                instruments. As technology and computers have improved, it has become more and more difficult to tell
                what is virtual and what is real.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Computing in Video Games</h3>
            <p>
                The video game industry is an aspect of entertainment that wouldn't exist without computing. As
                technology and computing has developed, this industry has grown alongside it and become more and more
                popular, particularly during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. The industry began with simple games, such
                as 1972's <i>Pong</i>, but as technology evolved, the design and capabilities of games changed alongside
                it, with more modern features such as ray-tracing creating photo-realistic games.
