            <h3>A General Overview</h3>
            <p>The entertainment industry has been greatly changed since technology has developed. From CGI in films to electronic music to the entire video games industry, computing and technology in general has aided in the entertainment industry.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Computing in Films</h3>
            <p>A very obvious example of computing in the films industry is animation, a medium for films (though it is often considered a genre). For a very long time, animated films were hand-drawn, frame by frame. This was a very tedious process and would mean artists would spend weeks or months trying to animate a single scene. The creation of 3D animation allowed for animators to make scenes quicker, as every individual frame didn't need to be drawn anymore. This form of animation rose to prominence through the 1995 movie <i>Toy Story</i> and throughout the 2000s, became the primary animation style, with traditional 2D styles becoming a rarity.</p>
            <p>In the modern animation industry, 3D animation is the most prominent art style, although there are variations in design and technique, such as with stop-motion. Hand-drawn animation is still used, most prominently in Japanese <i>anime</i>, but the vast majority of the industry makes use of technology.</p>
